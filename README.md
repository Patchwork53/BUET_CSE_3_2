# BUET_CSE_3_2
Offlines, Onlines and Projects of Level 3 Term 2

### CSE314
Bombed the onlines. The offlines are mostly correct.

### CSE318
All correct.

### CSE322
Some bugs in the Sockets offline when parallel downloading/uploading. <br>
As for the project, I did TCP Hystart which already has a working implementation in Linux Kernel. Just had to port it over. Easy.
